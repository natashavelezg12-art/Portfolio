## Commentary

In this updated version, several design improvements were made to enhance the layout and presentation of the portfolio.  
A LinkedIn logo was added beside the contact information to make the header more visually appealing and professional.  
A personal photo was included to add a human touch and strengthen personal branding.  
Additionally, pastel colors were applied for a clean and modern aesthetic, and the page was divided into two columns: the left column contains contact details, a short overview, and skills, while the right column presents professional experience and education.  
These adjustments help achieve a better balance between readability and design, making the document look both professional and distinctive.
